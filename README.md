## Formulation of the problem
 Right now there are more than 500000 non-profit organizations in Russia, which are Foundations, Law Offices, resource centers, sports institutions, etc. According to the logic of the state, OKVED codes that were developed for commercial organizations should be suitable for all of them, which in reality is not entirely true.
 Of the 500,000 NPOs, about 200,000 are now operating, of which 52% of organizations have OKVED 94.99 (Activities of other public organizations not included in other groups), which in fact can say little about the activities of the organization itself.
 
 ## Data
 Information about non-profit organizations is provided, which contains the following fields:
- full name of the organization,
- short name of the organization,
- direction of activity

The data will be classified according to the developed areas of activity on the basis of the Presidential Grants Fund
